# Gemini_Vulnerability_detection
This repo provides an implementation of the Gemini network in paper 《Neural Network-based Graph Embedding for Cross-Platform
Binary Code Similarity Detection》for vulnerability detection.

## Prepration and Data

Unzip the data by running:
```bash
unzip data.zip
```

The network is written using Tensorflow 1.4 in Python 2.7. You can install the dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Model Implementation

The model is implemented in graphnnSiamese.py.

Run the following code to train the model:
```bash
python train.py
```
or run python train.py -h to check the optional arguments.

After training, run the following code to evaluate the model:
```bash
python eval.py
```
or run python eval.py -h to check the optional arguments.

## Vulnerability Search

Run the following code to search vulnerabilities from file1 in file2:
```bash
python compare.py -i path/to/inputfile --vul path/to/vulfile
```

eg. 
```bash
python compare.py -i data/acfgSSL_7/openssl-1.0.1f-armeb-linux-O0v54.json --vul data/openssl_inline.json
```

The result file is stored in /result/.
